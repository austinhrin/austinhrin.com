This is my "portfolio" website. What it actually is, is a website that I use for testing, implementing, and fixing issues in actual applications on my own time. We've all been there. Get home from work and being bothered by a coding problem that you were trying to fix. That is exactly what this project started out as. A fun project that I could use to figure out more complex issues. I hope to expand on this project further and get more "applications" implemented into the project.
